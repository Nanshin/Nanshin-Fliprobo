11.Compiler reads the source code and outputs executable code
	while Interpreter converts the source code line-by-line
	during the RUN time.
	Compiler translates software written in a higher-level
	language into instructions that computer can understand
	while Interpreter completely translates a program written
	in high-level language into machine-level language
	Compiler is relatively complicated while Interpreter allows
	evaluation and modification of the program while it is executing.
	Compiler spends a lot of time analysing and processing
	the program while Interpreter spends relatively less time for
	analyzing and processing the program
	Compiler has a faster run time than interpreter.

12.The purpose of PYTHONPATH enviroment variable is to direct the users 
	search path for modules. It guides the operating system to search
	the directories listed in the variables in response to the query
	statement.

13.Use the strip() function to remove all leading and trailing spaces in a 
	string in python. For example; 
	Nanshin = "	Look out world here comes a great datascientist	  "
	print(Nanshin) will output;
	"	Look out world here comes a great datascientist   "
To remove the spaces,
	Nanshin.strip() or print(Nanshin.strip())
	My output will be;
	"Look out world here comes a great datascientist"
